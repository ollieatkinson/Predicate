# How to contribute

There are a just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Submitting a patch

1. It's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or feature you're intending to fix. Even if you think it's relatively minor, it's helpful to know what people are working on. Mention in the initial issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can be assigned to you.
2. It's important that each group of changes be done in separate branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the commits related to that bug or feature.
3. Any changes should always be accompanied by tests. The project already has good test coverage, so look at some of the existing tests if you're unsure how to go about it.
4. Do your best to have well-formed commit messages for each change. This provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools. See: http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
5. Finally, push the commits and submit a pull request.
